# HammingNeuralNetwork
Implementation of the Hamming neural network 

Hamming's Neural Network is a 2-layered recurrent neural network. It can be used for image recognition.

The weights at the first layer are constant and are initialised when network is trained on the input images. The weights on the second layer initialised by random numbers and change during work.
